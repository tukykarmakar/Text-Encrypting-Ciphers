# Text-Encrypting-Ciphers
This contains the codes for encrypting plain text message using different cipher algorithms. Codes can be in any programming language and translation to other programming languages is welcome. This is a collection of various plain text message encryption algorithm gathered by internet users, the source codes need not to be original work.

# Format
1. All files related to a cipher must be in a folder named aftere the cipher. Eg.: Folder Vignere Cipher will contain the source code files and output screenshots for it.
2. All source code files must have the name of the cipher, GitHub id of the code writer or submitter, and if it is written or acquired by the submitter at the begining as comments for crediting.
3. The source code files should have the filename format of <CipherName.ext>. Eg.: VignereCipher.py
